## General Introduction

(States your motivation clearly: why is it important / interesting to solve this problem?)
(Add real-world examples, if any)
(Put the problem into a historical context, from what does it originate? Are there already some proposed solutions?)

The amount of people living with limb loss is increasing. There is an estimate of 185,000 people that have gone through a upper or lower limb amputation each year. In the United States it is expected that the amount of poeple living with limb loss will double in 45 years. In 2005 that amount was estimated at 1.6 million people and it will increase to 3.6 million in 2050. The drastic increase is due to obesity which can cause dysvascular conditions like diabetes which can lead to limb amputation (Ziegler-Graham et al., 2008). It is not easy living with an lost limb and it becomes tougher to do simple everyday tasks. There is a phenomenon called phatom limb pain (PLP) where there is a sensation of pain in an absent limb in which 40% to 85% of amputees suffer from (Chau et al., 2017). Psychological disorders tend to appears in most people with PLP, including anxiety(66%) and depression(41%). Apart from taking pharmaceutical drugs, there are not many treatments for mititgating PLP. There are two main psycological interventions being used to treat PLP, mental imagery and mirror therapy. 

The purpose of this study is to explore different way of mitigating phantom limb pain in amputees and providing alternate methods for prosthetics training and rehabilitation. With the increasing amount of amputees, there is sure to be a need for more training. There has been studies done for VR therapies but they had small amount of test subject. So conducting more of these types of simulations can benefit to add more research and data to the community.

To tackle this problem, we plan on using Virtual Reality with the combination of the MYO armband. With VR we want to create realistic environments to immerse the user and help reduce pain with different forms of distractions. In the simulation we will have hand and/or arm assets to create the illusion of Virtual Body Ownership. This way the users mind can be convinced that the virtual arm is theirs. The myo armband will be used to collect muscle signals that then get translated to hand gestures. With the hand gestures we will create animations that correspond to the hand gestures the user is making. In addition, we want to create simple tasks that the user can perform. These task will be taken from the Southampton Hand Assessment Procedure (SHAP). It is a clinically validated hand function test.

## Related Work

Discuss briefly about published matter that technically relates to your proposed work in 4-5 paragraphs.

From several pieces of published literature, we have learned that amputation is becoming an increasingly larger problem worldwide and have learned possible treatments for the rehabilitation of amputees using virtual reality and myoelectric control. 
 
The three causes of limb loss in order of the largest are vascular diseases, trauma, and cancer.  In less than 50 years limb loss is expected to more than double. There are many statistics about amputation available. Amputee Coalition points out that within 5 years, almost half of the amputations caused by vascular diseases will die (Amputee Coalition, 2018). According to Advanced Amputee Solutions, LLC worldwide there are over 1 million limb amputations a year, that's one every 30 seconds (Advanced Amputee Solutions, LLC, 2012). As amputation becomes a larger problem, a better way to rehabilitate amputees is needed.  

Many of these papers explored the concept of virtual body ownership, this can be seen through various versions of the rubber hand illusion, where the subject is fooled to think a rubber hand is their own. The mind can be convinced that a virtual body is their own with synchronous actions between their body and the virtual reality model. Virtual embodiment has been used to allow people to see different things from different perspectives such as the rehabilitation of violent behavior allowing the aggressor to see a violent situation through the eyes of the victim or by reducing racism by putting a person in a body of a different color. Body ownership and its appearance have also been shown to have an effect on pain and body temperature.  

There have been several experiments done with rehabilitation and therapy after conditions such as amputation, stroke, and neurological impairment in the medical industry using newer technologies and techniques such as virtual reality, body sensors, and nerve remapping. Some studies have explored using the Myo Armband for this purpose such as collecting electromyography data to detect progress made in therapy and to control virtual hands. Different VR environments and games have been used in the rehabilitative process. Many of these studies have been done with a small number of test subjects and more studies can be done in this area. From these experiments we have seen VR be successful in reducing pain and anxiety, and as a distraction for people going through medical procedures.  

## Research Methods

We want to be able to know the pain level a patient is expriencing before and after they are inside the virtual reality environment. We will be using a Short-Form McGill Pain Questionnaire, Visual Analog Scale (VAS) and the Wong-Baker FACES pain scale, to see if there is any changes in pain. 

• McGill Pain Questionnaire: https://www.physio-pedia.com/Short-form_McGill_Pain_Questionnaire
• VAS: https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Pradeep_Koppolu3/publication/295250172/figure/fig1/AS:333063214125059@1456419866974/Visual-analog-scale.png
• Wong-Baker: http://wongbakerfaces.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/FACES_English_Blue1.jpg

For each SHAP test there will be task. We will measure a users performance by time of complete of each test. We will also collect completion times of each task, gender and age. With collecting completion time, we will compare those numbers with the represented virtual limb variables. Some of those variable are going to be: just a hand, hand w/forearm, skin color, gender, glove, no glove.
