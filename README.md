## General Introduction

(States your motivation clearly: why is it important / interesting to solve this problem?)
(Add real-world examples, if any)
(Put the problem into a historical context, from what does it originate? Are there already some proposed solutions?)

The amount of people living with limb loss is increasing. There is an estimate of 185,000 people that have gone through a upper or lower limb amputation each year. In the United States it is expected that the amount of poeple living with limb loss will double in 45 years. In 2005 that amount was estimated at 1.6 million people and it will increase to 3.6 million in 2050. The drastic increase is due to obesity which can cause dysvascular conditions like diabetes which can lead to limb amputation (Ziegler-Graham et al., 2008). It is not easy living with an lost limb and it becomes tougher to do simple everyday tasks. There is a phenomenon called phatom limb pain (PLP) where there is a sensation of pain in an absent limb in which 40% to 85% of amputees suffer from (Chau et al., 2017). Psychological disorders tend to appears in most people with PLP, including anxiety(66%) and depression(41%). Apart from taking pharmaceutical drugs, there are not many treatments for mititgating PLP. There are two main psycological interventions being used to treat PLP, mental imagery and mirror therapy. 

The purpose of this study is to explore different way of mitigate phantom pain in amputees and provide alternate methods for prosthtics training and rehabilitation.




- There is a need for prostheic arm training
- Mitigating phantom limb pain
- A large increase in the number of amputees is expected due to rising obesity rates

(I tell sutdents to answer the questions, one paragaph each to start if you are lost)

(Problem Statement. One paragraph to describe the prob-lem that you are tackling.)


There is an increase in amputees yearly. The amount of people living with limb loss in the U.S. is expected to more than double in 45 years from 1.6 million in 2005 to 3.6 million in 2050. The drastic increase is due to obesity which can cause dysvascular conditions like diabetes which can lead to limb amputation (Ziegler-Graham et al., 2008).There is a lack of training and rehabilitation for amputees and paralysis victim. 40% - 85% of amputees suffer from phantom limb pain (Chau et al., 2017).

(Motivation. Why is this problem interesting and relevant to the research community?)

The purpose of this study is to explore ways to mitigate phatom limb pain in amputees and provide alternate methods for training and rehabiliation.

(Proposed Solution. How do we propose to tackle this problem (that has been identified in the previous para-graphs, is interesting to the community, and has yet to be tackled by other researchers)?)

Creating VR eniroment to immerse the user and better assist in training and rehabilitation.
