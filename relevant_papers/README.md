#### Summary of Paper

**Immersive Virtual Reality Therapy with Myoelctric Control for Treatment-resistant Phantom Limb Pain: Case Report**

This paper is about using immersive virtual reality therapy along with Myoelectic control to help treat Phantom Limb Pain (PLP), pain in a missing limb. Using these tools this experiment created an immersive virtual reality (VR) version of traditional mirror therapy which has the patient view their intact limb in a mirror to make it appear as their amputated limb. The VR environment included  a virtual kitchen with interactive components such as pots and apples which included virtual hands. This experiment was done with a 49-year old male who became an amputee after a workplace injury. The subject reported an overall pain relief from the immersive virtual reality therapy with myoelectric control.

#### Executive Summary

Overall this is a reproducible and paper with a clear message. Immersive virtual reality therapy with myoelctric control is a possibility for treatment of Phantom Limb Pain. 

#### Clarity of Exposition

This paper is clear and easy to understand. It does a good job of explaining the experiment that was conducted. 

#### Quality of References

According to Google Scholar, this article was cited by 2 people. This paper uses 20 different sources, many of them can be found on PubMed.gov, a publication website by the National Center for Biotechnology Information, U.S. National Library of Medicine. The references that have been used to produce this article, "Immersive Virtual Reality Therapy with Myoelectric Control for Treatment-resistant Phantom Limb Pain: Case Report" have been cited by other people. They seem like reliable sources that this paper used. 


#### Reproducibility

This paper is reproducible. The VR hardware setup, the Myo Band, a PC, VR games- Autoshield and Eleven: Table Tennis, and a room with a clear space of at least 5 ft. x 6.5 ft used in this study are fairly easy to get access to. A virtual interactive kitchen environment can be built using Unity. Even though Phantom Limb Pain is common, finding an amputee with this condition would probably be the hardest part of the experiment to secure.This experiment can be reproduced and modified. This study was only done with one patient so results may vary.

#### Explanation of Rating

I would rate this paper a 3.5, it was an interesting and easy to read paper, but I wouldn’t say it was the best thing I ever read.
