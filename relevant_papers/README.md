Immersive Virtual Reality Therapy with Myoelctric Control for Treatment-resistant Phantom Limb Pain: Case Report

This paper is about using immersive virtual reality therapy along with Myoelectic control to help treat Phantom Limb Pain (PLP), pain in a missing limb. Using these tools this experiment created an immersive virtual reality (VR) version of traditional mirror therapy which has the patient view their intact limb in a mirror to make it appear as their amputated limb. The VR environment included  a virtual kitchen with interactive components such as pots and apples which included virtual hands. This experiment was done with a 49-year old male who became an amputee after a workplace injury. The subject reported an overall pain relief from the immersive virtual reality therapy with myoelectric control.
